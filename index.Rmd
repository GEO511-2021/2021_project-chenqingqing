## Mobile location data of users

To help get sense of the mobile location data, I take 30 data points as examples and present them in Table 1. Each data point includes four attributes:

- `u_id`: the unique identifier for each user;
- `timestamp`: the specific time for each data point created;
- `grid_id`: the location for each data point created;
- `home`: the inferred home location of each user.


```{r}
# identified home locations 
identified_hms <- readRDS(here("data/raw/hm_hmlc.rds")) %>% 
  mutate(home = as.integer(home))

# mobile location data points of users 
df <- readRDS(here("data/raw/mobility_sample.rds")) %>% 
  sample_frac(size = 1) 

# join home locations to users 
df <- df %>% left_join(., identified_hms, by = c("u_id" = "u_id"))
DT::datatable(df %>% head(30),
              options = list(pageLength = 5), 
              caption = "Table 1: Random examples of the mobile location data.")

# grid cells with data points 
considered_grid_cells <- df$grid_id %>% unique()
```


# Social Diversity Analysis

## Separate data with biweek interval

In order to compare the potential changes of diversity over time, the first step is to separate the data into multiple periods. I use a two-week interval and separate the data into 26 periods.

```{r eval=F}
# create break points of every two weeks 
biweekly_seqs <- seq(as.POSIXct("2020-01-01"), as.POSIXct("2020-12-31"), by = "2 weeks") %>%
  as.Date() 

# give each period a label, easier for subsequent analysis
prepare_labels <- function(index.start, index.end, weekly_seqs){
  start_day <- weekly_seqs[index.start] %>% format(., "%b %d")
  end_day <- weekly_seqs[index.end] %>% format(., "%b %d")
  paste(start_day, "-", end_day)
}
biweek_labels <- map2_chr(seq(1, 26, 1), seq(2, 27, 1), function(x, y) prepare_labels(x, y, biweekly_seqs))

# separate biweek data and store them 
get_biweekly_data <- function(df, biweek_labels, index.start, index.end){
  output <- df %>%
    mutate(date = as.Date(timestamp)) %>% 
    filter(date >= biweekly_seqs[index.start] & date < biweekly_seqs[index.end]) %>% 
    mutate(period = biweek_labels[index.start])
  saveRDS(output, file = paste0(here("data/derived/biweekly-data/biweek_"), index.start, ".rds"))
}

## if function: if all biweekly data files exist, do not need to re-run the get_biweekly_data fun
if(length(list.files(here("data/derived/biweekly-data"), pattern = "*.rds")) != 26){
  ## parallel mapping
  map2(seq(1, 26, 1), seq(2, 27, 1), function(x, y) get_biweekly_data(df, biweek_labels, x, y))
}
```

## Construct spatial sectors 

To operationalize diversity, one important step is to construct the spatial sectors. The dynamic sectors change along with grid cell locations is created based on different radius distance and directions [@chen_entangled_2021]. An example of spatial sectors of a grid cell is shown in Figure 2, where visitors visiting from the same sectors are considered as the same "species". The concept of "species" will be used in the subsequent diversity analysis. 

```{r}
# step 1: get centers of grid cells 
grid_centroids <- grids %>% 
  filter(grid_id %in% considered_grid_cells) %>% 
  st_centroid()
```

```{r}
# step 2: create buffers for each grid cell 
## buffer radius
radius <- c(1000, 3000, 5000, 7000, 10000, 20000, 30000, 60000)
## draw buffers 
draw_buffers <- function(df_centroids, radius, grid_index){
  grid_centroid <- df_centroids %>% filter(grid_id == grid_index)
  buffers <- list()
  for (i in 1:length(radius)){
    if(i == 1){
      buffers[[i]] <- grid_centroid %>% 
        st_buffer(., dist = radius[1]) %>% 
        mutate(radius = radius[1])
    } else{
      buffers[[i]] <- st_difference(
        grid_centroid %>% st_buffer(., dist = radius[i]),
        grid_centroid %>% st_buffer(., dist = radius[i-1])) %>% 
        dplyr::select(-grid_id.1) %>% 
        mutate(radius = radius[i])
    }
  }
  do.call(rbind, buffers)
}

##!!!note: this step takes more than 1 hour, the processed data is stored in `data/derived/` folder, which can be directly loaded. 
## process all grid cells 
if(file.exists(here("data/derived/grid_buffers.rds"))){
  grid_buffers <- readRDS(here("data/derived/grid_buffers.rds"))
}else{
  # parallel mapping 
  grid_buffers <- map_df(grid_centroids$grid_id, function(x) draw_buffers(grid_centroids, radius, x))
  saveRDS(grid_buffers, file = here("data/derived/grid_buffers.rds"))
}
```

```{r}

    dplyr::select(grid_id) 
}

}
```

## Analyze diversity 

After constructing spatial sectors for each grid cell, I apply the concept of biological diversity from ecology [@tramer_bird_1969; @maignan_bio-ecological_2003] and use Shannon's index ($H$) to measure the diversity. The Shannon's index is calculated as: 

$$H = -\sum_{i = 1}^{S}p_ilnp_i$$

where $p_i$ is the proportion of users that allied to "species" $i$ (i.e., sectors in this study) and $S$ is the frequency of "species".

## Static visualization 

The violin plot shown below represents the kernel probability density of the diversity at different biweekly periods starting from Feb 26, 2020 (one month before the 1st lockdown) to Sep 23, 2020 (i.e., one month after the 2nd lockdown). The horizontal red dash line refers to the average diversity of all geographical places over the whole period and the two vertical red dash lines refer to the two lockdown mundanes (one at March 25, 2020 and the other on Aug 12, 2020). On the date of the 1st lockdown, New Zealand moved to Alert Level 4 (highest alert level) and the entire nation went into self-isolation. On the date of the 2nd lockdown, Auckland resion moved to Alert Level 3. We can observe that the diversity drops immediate after the two lockdowns, indicating the timely effect of the stringent measures put in place.

df_divs_combined <- df_divs_combined %>%

```


To compare the changes over space, I visualized the spatial distribution of each biweekly period as shown below. It is obviously to see that the spatial patterns are quite different. For example, during Mar 25 to Apr 08, we can see the diversity has significantly decreased compared to the that during Mar 11 to Mar 25, especial in the central CBD area. In addition, the number of geographical places that has diversity value (i.e., hexagonal grid cells) became much smaller. This is because the lockdown has marked drastic alternations on people's daily movements, therefore, most of places showed a sharp drop of visiting frequency, or even no visitors at all. This again indicates the timely effect of lockdown mundane on human mobility. 

Moreover, the diversity remained relatively low during the four biweekly periods after the 1st lockdown, and slowly increased on the 5th biweekly, as New Zealand started to move to Alert Level 1, which means the restrictions were released. We can see than the diversity slowly increase and the diversity returned to a comparable spatial pattern before the lockdown around July. Similar changes was observed for the 2nd lockdown, where the diversity delined immediately after the lockdown but not as significant as the first lockdown. The possible reasons could be that the 2nd lockdown was less strict than the 1st lockdown and people may be getting fatigue about it.

## Interactive visualization 

The interactive dashboard allows users to investigate underlying insights of specific metrics from data or from measured results. User can choose metrics that they are interested in and visualize results in different way. This is especially useful in this project as the interactive dashboard provides the flexibility to zoom in specific place in the city and examine the metrics (e.g., social diversity, standard deviation of diversity, travel distance of visitors) in that place. From this point of view, I created a interactive dashboard to help understand the outcomes. With the dashboard, you can easily to zoom in and zoom out, choose different bi-weekly period or specific location (grid cell ID). Different metrics are presented in different pages, but they are synchronous. In other words, the results of different metrics changes simultaneously with the selected date range or grid cell. The video below shows a simple demo of the dashboard. As the dashboard is built upon Shinny apps and it is running locally, so I don't provide codes here.

# Conclusions

In this project, I focused on comparing the changes in human mobility patterns under the COVID-19 impact, especially during the stringent lockdown periods. In order to compare the potential changes, I took a mobility indicator named diversity as a proxy of human footprints and conducted the analysis leveraging mobile location data. The results show the diversity significantly declined after the two lockdown mundane, indicating the strict measures put in place have timely effects on human footprints. This is expected as people were required to remain at home and only went out for essentials during the lockdown periods, therefore, results in significantly different diversity patterns in space and time. 

In addition, the results also show the diversity decreased less after the 2nd lockdown compared to that after the 1st lockdown. Moreover, the diversity showed a slow increase after the restrictions released. It would be interesting to compare the recovery rate of different lockdown. Another direction could be looking into places that have the largest diversity changes and combine other factors, such as socio-economics and demographic characteristics, to understand the underlying insights.
